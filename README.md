# Polar-Rebinning
Rebin cartesian data onto a polar grid more precisely than most common methods.
The overlap area between each cartesian grid and each polar grid is calculated, stored, and later used to rebin cartesian data onto a polar grid.

See individual functions for more detailed documentation.
